## What is this?

This package turns a file into the `LintResult` schema that ESLint uses for its
formatters

## When should I use this?

While vfile and ESLint results are different, they do overlap in some places.
This package can be used to integrate with ESLint in those cases.
In other cases, a custom vfile utility might be a better solution.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 14.14+ and 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install vfile-to-eslint
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {toESLint} from 'https://esm.sh/vfile-to-eslint@3'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {toESLint} from 'https://esm.sh/vfile-to-eslint@3?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import remark from 'remark'
import remarkPresetLintRecommended from 'remark-preset-lint-recommended'
import eslintFormatterPretty from 'eslint-formatter-pretty'
import {toESLint} from 'vfile-to-eslint'

const file = await remark()
  .use(remarkPresetLintRecommended)
  .process('## Hello world!')

console.log(eslintFormatterPretty(toESLint([file])))
```
